# WeRateDogs_analysis
An analysis of the WeRateDogs twitter data

In this project, I analyzed data from the eccentric dog-rating twitter account WeRateDogs.  Users sned pictures of their dogs to the account, which then rates them on a scale of 1-10, though the ratings typically exceed the scale of 10. Data was gathered from a tweet archive on hand, additional data pulled from the twitter API, and a seperate table of dog breed predictions made by running tweeted images through a neural network on the Udacity servers.
